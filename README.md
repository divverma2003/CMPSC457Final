# Crossy Road
This project is a prototype/clone of the somewhat infamous mobile game 'Crossy Road'. It utilizes transformations, basic physics, projections, lighting, and other core computer graphics concepts to deliver a product featuring the core functionalities of the original gameâ€”albeit with some bugs.

The build file is included for anyone interested in playing the game.
